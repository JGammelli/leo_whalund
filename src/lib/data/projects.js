I am looking for a place where I can grow as a designer and work together with a close knit team.",

It is still at the stage where I am mostly translating the board game over to Unity, it is playable with the core mechanics implemented. Since it is made mainly for testing out mechanics, the balance is currently a bit off and it is lacking the visual clarity that the board game has. I am hoping to start testing with more transformative mechanics soon, such as cards being able to attack their own teammates for benefits and buffs.",

We tried making somewhat of a complete game in 12 hours and the result is an unpolished main mechanic. The goal we missed was making the slice feel satisfying to use. Solving this would start with making the hitbox larger, making it hit in front and around the player when the dash ends along with making the slice visually satisfying through effects and juice.`,
