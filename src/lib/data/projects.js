    "I have had a passion for games ever since my parents bought a Gameboy Advance and Pokemon LeafGreen cartridge. I love crafting mechanics, testing and improving them until they play and feel the way they should. I am a social, happy and driven person who works best in teams where communication is free flowing and clear. I am looking for a place where I can grow as a designer and work together with a close knit team.",

Spending most of my time getting the combat and feel of the game to be the best it could with the tools available. Although it has many flaws (to be expected from a game made in 10 weeks) I am still happy with what we achieved.",

I tried making an open map where the player can try out different paths with varying obstacles, some requiring precise maneuvering, others timing and a few with both. Despite the basic functionality of the  obstacles, the game provides a real challenge even for experienced platformer players.",

A result of me wanting to explore some key mechanical differences in online and offline card games and a project I’m still working on from time to time. It is still at the stage where I am mostly translating the board game over to Unity, it is playable with the core mechanics implemented. Since it is made mainly for testing out mechanics, the balance is currently a bit off and it is lacking the visual clarity that the board game has. I am hoping to start testing with more transformative mechanics soon, such as cards being able to attack their own teammates for benefits and buffs.",

We tried making somewhat of a complete game in 12 hours and the result is an unpolished main mechanic. The goal we missed was making the slice feel satisfying to use. Solving this would start with making the hitbox larger, making it hit in front and around the player when the dash ends along with making the slice visually satisfying through effects and juice.",
